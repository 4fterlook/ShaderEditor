Contributions Are Welcome
=========================

To keep things in shape, I kindly ask you to

* comply to the existing [code style][style].
* be [consistent][pikestyle].
* be [pragmatic][perils].
* choose [clear and simple semantics][semantics].
* have many short methods instead of a lot of [indent][kernel].
* test.
* write good a [commit message][commit].
* open a [pull request][pull].

If you can get your fingers to type this way, I may still happily accept
your contribution but probably won't merge it directly but make it fit in
first. This may take time.

Once your contribution is merged, I'll add your name or call sign to
CONTRIBUTORS unless you don't want that.

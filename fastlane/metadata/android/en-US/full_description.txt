Some devices limit GPU usage to consume less power when not plugged in. Always check the performance with the soft keyboard hidden and the power cord off. A shader should make at least around 30 fps to not slow down the UI if you intend to use it as a live wallpaper.

Unfortunately error information is disabled on some devices (e.g. Huawei Ideos X3, Asus Transformer). Error highlighting/reporting is not possible on these devices.
